## About the Challenge

Miles Journey is the english version of "Jornada Milhas" project proposed on the 7th Challenge Backend edition by Alura.

In this Challenge, you will:
- Develop a REST API to be integrated into the frontend.
- Build an API following weekly updates on the challenge's Trello sheet.
- Build the application's frontend from scratch based on a Figma project [available here](https://www.figma.com/design/1qD4hmpnvxoeHRC1cbWKgR/Challenge-Escola-de-Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o?node-id=0-1&node-type=CANVAS&t=vmOALUYiTmTVyUxP-0).
- **EXTRA:** Implement Authentication and Authorization features.
- **EXTRA:** Integrate artificial intelligence OpenAI with the application.
- **EXTRA:** Automation of tasks by running on server background.

## Project Folder Structure

This project extends Laravelâ€™s default structure with additional directories to improve modularity and code readability by isolating functionality. Below is a description of the added folders:

- `src/app/Builders`: Custom EloquentBuilder classes for abstracting common database queries.
- `src/app/Casts`: Custom Cast classes for data conversion within Eloquent Models and database.
- `src/app/Enums`: Enumerable values to standardize variables across the application.
- `src/app/Helpers`: Helper classes and traits for use in Controllers or Services.
- `src/app/ValueObjects`: ValueObject classes to manage value conversion and reduce handling errors.
- `src/app/Http/Responses`: Centralized response classes for standardized responses throughout the application.
- `src/app/Http/Controllers/Api`: API controller classes.
- `src/app/Http/Controllers/Api/Auth`: Authentication controller classes.

For Docker-based Laravel Render deployments, additional directories include:

- `src/conf/`: NGNIX configuration files for deployment.
- `src/scripts/`: Post-build scripts (_e.g._, Composer and Artisan commands).


## Application Architecture & Key Features

This section provides an overview of key features implemented throughout the application:

- **OpenAI API Integration:** Available as a dedicated service. [(View OpenAIService class)](./app/Services/OpenAIService.php).
- **Background Task Management:** Utilizes Laravel's task scheduling for background processes management. [(View implementation)](./app/Console/Kernel.php).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented using Laravel Sanctum.
- **Helper Traits & Classes:** Abstracts common functionalities from Controllers, improving code reusability and maintainability. [(View helpers)](./app/Helpers/).
- **Auto-Generated UUIDs:** Automatically generates UUIDs for models upon creation, ensuring unique identifiers. [(View implementation)](./app/Models/Traits/CreateWithUuid.php).
- **Request Validation:** Request classes abstract input validation logic, promoting clean and organized Controllers. [(View requests)](./app/Http/Requests/).
- **API Response Abstraction:** Higher-order response classes abstract API responses from Controllers, standardizing response structure. [(View ApiResponse class)](./app/Http/Responses/ApiResponse.php).
- **CORS Middleware:** Controls access to the API by unregistered addresses, enhancing security.
- **Custom Eloquent Builder Classes:** Abstracts common database queries, making query logic reusable and easier to maintain. [(View example)](./app/Builders/DestinationBuilder.php).
- **Cast Classes for Data Conversion:** Manages data conversion within Eloquent Models, ensuring consistency between models and the database. [(View example)](./app/Casts/PriceCast.php).
- **Value Object Classes:** Handles value conversion and reduces errors in value management. [(View example)](./app/ValueObjects/Price.php).
